# HelsinkiÂ tanssii
My current work in progress. Small React + Spring project to better visualize [My Helsinki](https://www.myhelsinki.fi/fi/search) dance event data.

City of Helsinki has an [open API](http://open-api.myhelsinki.fi/) for all the events happening in Helsinki and capital area of Finland. Here I use it to create bit more simplified query tool to focus on gathering events related solely on dance.

Spring backend is used as a middleware to overcome some CORS policy issues.
